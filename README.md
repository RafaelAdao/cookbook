# My programming Cookbook

The aim of this repository is to provide a collection of programming recipes that I have found useful in the past. The recipes are language agnostic and should be applicable to any programming language. The recipes are organized by topic and are meant to be short and to the point. The idea is to provide a quick reference for not-so common programming tasks.
